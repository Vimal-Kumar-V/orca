Orca is a test automation application written in the Rust programming language, designed to help with automating applications through record and playback functionality. It is based on a low-code platform, which allows users to easily create and customize automation scripts without the need for extensive programming knowledge.

Orca allows users to record their actions while using an application, and then play them back to test the application's functionality. This can save time and effort in the testing process, as it eliminates the need for manual testing.

One of the benefits of using Orca, which is written in Rust, is the performance and reliability that the Rust language provides. Rust is known for its safety and speed, making it an ideal choice for building applications that require robustness and efficiency.
